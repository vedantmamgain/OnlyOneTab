## OnlyOneTab 🚀

**Focus on the task, not the clutter.**

OnlyOneTab is a smart Chrome extension that automatically detects and closes duplicate tabs based on custom rules. Whether you need to stop multiple instances of WhatsApp Web from screaming for attention, or you want to consolidate all your GitHub repositories into a single browsing stream, OnlyOneTab handles it for you.

 

## ✨ Features

  * **🎯 Smart De-duplication:** Automatically switches you to an existing tab instead of opening a new one.
  * **📁 Tab Grouping:** Automatically group related tabs by domain using Chrome's native Tab Groups feature.
  * **⚙️ Granular Control:** You decide which sites are tracked. Use global tracking or define specific rules for high-noise apps.
  * **⚡ Quick Templates:** One-click setup for popular tools like **WhatsApp, Slack, Notion, and Google Workspace**.
  * **🔍 Flexible Pattern Matching:**
      * **Exact Match:** Lock down specific subdomains (e.g., `web.whatsapp.com`).
      * **Wildcards:** manage entire ecosystems (e.g., `*.google.com`).
  * **🧹 Housekeeping Tools:** Instant buttons to "Close All Duplicates", "Merge All Windows", or "Group Related Tabs."

## 🧠 Pattern Logic

OnlyOneTab offers powerful logic to determine what counts as a "duplicate."

| Pattern Type | Example Input | Behavior | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Exact Domain** | `web.whatsapp.com` | Matches only this exact URL. | Single Page Apps (WhatsApp, Spotify) |
| **Wildcard** | `*.google.com` | Matches any subdomain (`mail.`, `calendar.`). | Suites like Google Workspace |
| **Base Domain** | `github.com` | Matches the root and all subdomains. | Sites where you browse many areas |

### Grouping Strategies

For every pattern, you can decide how tabs are treated:

1.  **By Subdomain:** `mail.google.com` and `drive.google.com` are treated as **separate** tabs.
2.  **All as One:** All pages under `github.com` (issues, PRs, code) are treated as **one** single tab.

## ⚙️ Settings Toggles

OnlyOneTab provides two main behavior toggles (available in popup and options page):

| Toggle | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Limit to One Tab** | ✅ On | Automatically close duplicate tabs and switch to the existing one |
| **Auto-Group Tabs** | ❌ Off | Automatically group related tabs together using Chrome Tab Groups |

### How Auto-Group Works

- Groups are only created when there are **2 or more tabs** from the same domain
- Single tabs remain ungrouped until a second tab from the same domain is opened
- Use the **"Group Related Tabs"** button in the popup to manually group all existing tabs by domain
